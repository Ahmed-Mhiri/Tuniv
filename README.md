## About The Project

Struggling to find clear answers for your university modules? Wasting time in noisy and disorganized Facebook or WhatsApp groups? **Tuniv** is the solution.

This platform provides a structured environment where students can ask technical and academic questions, get high-quality answers from their peers and professors, and build a lasting knowledge base for their specific university and field of study. It's built to function like a focused, academic "Reddit" for the Tunisian university ecosystem, fostering a community of learning and collaboration.



### Key Features

## Architecture & Design

This project is guided by a comprehensive set of product design and software architecture documents. These diagrams provide a complete blueprint of the platform's vision, user experience, and technical implementation.

### Product Design

These documents define the **"who, what, and why"** of the platform from a user's perspective. They ensure we are building the right product for the right people.

* ‚û°Ô∏è **[User Persona](./docs/product-design/user-persona.md)** - An in-depth look at our target user, Amine.
* ‚û°Ô∏è **[User Journey Map](./docs/product-design/user-journey-map.md)** - Visualizing the "before and after" experience.
* ‚û°Ô∏è **[Site Map](./docs/product-design/site-map.md)** - The structural blueprint of all screens and pages.
* ‚û°Ô∏è **[User Flows](./docs/product-design/user-flows.md)** - Step-by-step paths for key tasks like asking questions and messaging.

---

### Software Architecture

These documents outline the **"how"**‚Äîthe technical blueprint for the system's construction, operation, and scalability.

* ‚û°Ô∏è **[System Architecture](./docs/software-architecture/system-architecture.md)** - A high-level view of the entire cloud infrastructure.
* ‚û°Ô∏è **[Microservices Model](./docs/software-architecture/microservices-model.md)** - The backend service-oriented architecture.
* ‚û°Ô∏è **[Database Schema (ERD)](./docs/software-architecture/database-schema.md)** - The complete structure of our PostgreSQL database.
* ‚û°Ô∏è **[API Contract](./docs/software-architecture/api-contract.md)** - The formal specification for our REST API.
* ‚û°Ô∏è **[CI/CD Pipeline](./docs/software-architecture/ci-cd-pipeline.md)** - The automated build, test, and deployment process.
